# Where to go From Here?

Some topics that we did not cover or only briefly touched upon that you might want to explore next/further:

- Analyses for more than one video: use for-loops, functions from the `apply` family or `map` functions from the [`purrr` package](https://purrr.tidyverse.org/)

--

- Advanced text mining and NLP (going beyond [bag-of-words approaches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bag-of-words_model)): check out the introductions/tutorials mentioned in the session on basic text analysis or this [presentation by Cosima Meyer](https://cosimameyer.rbind.io/talk/nlp-rladies-tunis/)

--

- Alternatives to dictionary-based approaches for sentiment analysis: See the publications by [Boukes et al., 2019](https://doi.org/10.1080/19312458.2019.1671966) and [van Atteveldt et al., 2021](https://doi.org/10.1080/19312458.2020.1869198)

--

- Supervised machine learning for text analysis: The online book [Supervised Machine Learning for Text Analysis in R](https://smltar.com/) by Emil Hvitfeldt and Julia Silge is an excellent resource here

--

- Topic models (unsupervised ML): To get started you can, e.g., have a look at the introductions/tutorials by [Rachael Tatman](https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/nlp-in-r-topic-modelling), [Julia Silge](https://juliasilge.com/blog/sherlock-holmes-stm/), or the [*Pew Research Center*](https://medium.com/pew-research-center-decoded/an-intro-to-topic-models-for-text-analysis-de5aa3e72bdb)

# Acknowledgements `r ji("heart")`

All slides were created with the `R` package [`xaringan`](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan) which builds on [`remark.js`](https://remarkjs.com), [`knitr`](http://yihui.name/knitr), and [`R Markdown`](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com). The exercises were created with the [`unilur` package](https://github.com/koncina/unilur).  

The original inspiration for our emoji parsing and analyses came from a [blog post](http://opiateforthemass.es/articles/emoji-analysis/) by [Jessica Peterka-Bonetta](https://github.com/today-is-a-good-day). The `workshop.css` file we used for the layout of the slides includes elements from `CSS` files for `xaringan` presentations by [Frederik Aust](https://github.com/crsh) and [David Zimmer](https://github.com/DavZim).  

We thank Janina GÃ¶tsche and the *GESIS* Training team for taking good care of the organization of this workshop, and all of you for participating!

# Practice time
## You now have some time to start or continue working on your own *YouTube* data analysis project. We'll be around, so feel free to ask questions while you work on or get started with your projects.
