# About you

- What's your name?  

- Where do you work?  

- What is your experience with `R`?

- Why/how do you want to use *YouTube* for your research?


---

# Prerequisites for this course

- Working version of `R` and [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)

- Some basic knowledge of `R`  

- Interest in working with *YouTube* data

---

# Workshop Structure & Materials

- The workshop consists of a combination of lectures and hands-on exercises

- Slides and other materials are available at

[https://github.com/jobreu/youtube-workshop-gesis-2021](https://github.com/jobreu/youtube-workshop-gesis-2021)

We also put the PDF versions of the slides and some other materials on the [GESIS Ilias repository](https://ilias.gesis.org/) for this course.

---

# Zoom Etiquette

- If possible, we invite you to turn on your camera (during the lecture and exercise parts); feel free to use a virtual background if you want to

```{r tweet, echo = F}
tweet_embed("https://twitter.com/PhdExhausted/status/1331956737683853318",
            theme = "dark",
            maxwidth = 400,
            align = "center")
```

---

# Zoom Etiquette

- Please mute your microphones unless you are asking a question

- Asking questions:
  - If you have an immediate question during the lecture parts, please send it via text chat to one of the two people who are currently not presenting (the person you contact will either be able to answer your question directly or later forward it to the presenter)
  - If you have a question that is not urgent and might be interesting for everybody, please wait until the end of the lecture part, then use the "raise hand" function in *Zoom* and ask your question via audio/video
  - During the exercises you can also use "raise hand" + audio/video (if you have a question that might be interesting for others as well) or public or private text chat messages to ask questions

- We will try to provide (one-on-one) "tech support" during the exercises (please contact us via the text chat if you have any technical issues/questions that we can solve)

# Preliminaries: Base `R` vs. `tidyverse`

In this course, we will use a mixture of base `R` and `tidyverse` code as Julian prefers base `R`, Johannes prefers the `tidyverse`, and Ro is agnostic.

ICYC, here are some opinions [for](http://varianceexplained.org/r/teach-tidyverse/) and [against](https://blog.ephorie.de/why-i-dont-use-the-tidyverse) using/teaching the `tidyverse`.

--

Johannes' experience with learning and teaching the `tidyverse` is something like this...
```{r tidyverse meme, out.width = "60%"}
include_graphics("./images/tidyverse_vs_baseR_meme.jpg")
```

---

# The `tidyverse`

If you've never seen `tidyverse` code, the most important thing to know is the `%>%` [(pipe) operator](https://magrittr.tidyverse.org/reference/pipe.html). Put briefly, the pipe operator takes an object (which can be the result of a previous function) and pipes it as the first argument into the next function. This means that `function(data = x, value = y)` is equivalent to `x %>% function(y)`.

It may also be worthwhile to know/remember that `tidyverse` functions normally produce [`tibbles`](https://tibble.tidyverse.org/) which are a special type of dataframe (and most `tidyverse` functions also expect dataframes/tibbles as input to their first argument).

--

If you want a short primer (or need a quick refresher) on the `tidyverse`, you can check out the blog posts by [Martin Frigaard](http://www.storybench.org/getting-started-with-tidyverse-in-r/) or [Dominic Royé](https://dominicroye.github.io/en/2020/a-very-short-introduction-to-tidyverse/). For a more in-depth exploration you can, e.g., also have a look at the materials for the workshop [*Data Wrangling & Exploration with the Tidyverse in R*](https://github.com/jobreu/tidyverse-workshop-gesis-2019) that Johannes taught together with Stefan Jünger at GESIS in May 2019.

---

# Preliminaries: What's in a name?

Another thing you might notice when looking at our code is that we love `r ji("snake")` as much as `r ji("camel")`.

```{r cases, out.width = "75%"}
include_graphics("./images/camel_snake_kebab.jpg")
```

# Why is *YouTube* relevant?
- Largest / most important online video platform<br /><small>([Alexa Traffic Ranks, 2019](https://www.alexa.com/topsites); [Konijn, Veldhuis, & Plaisier, 2013](https://doi.org/10.1089/cyber.2012.0357))</small>

# Why is *YouTube* data interesting for research?

- Content producers and users generate huge amounts of data

- Useful for research on media content, communicators, and user interaction

- Data publicly available 

- Relatively easy to retrieve via *YouTube* API
