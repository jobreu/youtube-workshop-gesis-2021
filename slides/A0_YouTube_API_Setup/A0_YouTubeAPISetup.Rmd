# Setting up API access to the *YouTube* API
 
To effectively work with *YouTube* data, we need access to its Application Programming Interface (API). As this process, unfortunately, can be a bit tedious, we prepared this preliminary tutorial so you don't have to spend time setting up your API access during the workshop. Please follow this tutorial and check if the setup works before the workshop. If your setup does not work, feel free to contact us before the workshop (the sooner the better) and we'll try to assist you in setting up access to the *YouTube* API. If, for some reason, setting up access to the API does not work for you and we don't find a solution or if you cannot access the API during the workshop, we will have some data prepared that you can then work with in the workshop.

# Setting up API Access
  
- For starters, you need a *Gmail* account
- We suggest that you create a new account specifically for this workshop, so you don't mess up or accidentally share the credentials of your private or work account 

- You can create a new account [here](https://accounts.google.com/signup/v2/webcreateaccount?service=mail&continue=https%3A%2F%2Fmail.google.com%2Fmail%2F&ltmpl=googlemail&gmb=exp&biz=false&flowName=GlifWebSignIn&flowEntry=SignUp)

- Next, you need to:
  - Sign up for the *Google developer console*
  - Create a new project
  - Activate the *YouTube Data API*
  - Create authentication credentials
  - Test the credentials from R

We will explain these steps in detail on the following slides.

---
# Google Developer Console
  
- Go to the [Developer Console](https://console.developers.google.com) and log in with your (new) *Google* Account

![plot](Images/1.png)
![plot](Images/2.png)

---
# Google Developer Console

- Create a new project by clicking the "Create" button in the top right corner

![plot](Images/3.png)

---
# Project Limit
  
- You only have a limited number of projects you can create, so be careful not
to constantly delete and create new ones!

- More information on project limits can be found [here](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/6330231)

---
# Creating a New Project
  
- Specify a project name (you do not have to specify an organization) and click "create" once you are done

![plot](Images/4.png)

---
# Activate the YouTube Data v3 API
  
- Click the button "Enable APIs and Services"

![plot](Images/5.png)

---
# Activate the YouTube Data v3 API
  
- Enter "YouTube" in the search bar

![plot](Images/6.png)

---
# Activate the YouTube Data v3 API

- Click on "YouTube Data API v3" 

![plot](Images/7.png)

---
# Activate the YouTube Data v3 API

- Activate the API by clicking the "Enable" button

![plot](Images/9.png)

---
# Obtaining OAuth credentials

- The API is now enabled, but we still need credentials to use it

- Click on the "Credentials" pane in the menu on the left side

![plot](Images/10.png)

---
# Obtaining OAuth credentials

- Click the "+ Create Credentials" button and select "OAuth Client ID" from the dropdown menu

![plot](Images/12.png)

---
# Obtaining OAuth credentials

- To be able to create new credentials, we first need to configure a consent screen for our "app"

- Click the blue "Configure Consent Screen" button on the right side of your screen

![plot](Images/13.png)

---
# Configuring the Consent Screen

- Enter the name of your "app" in the the field "application name", scroll to the bottom of the page, and click "save"

![plot](Images/14.png)


---
# Obtaining OAuth credentials

- On the following screen, select the "Credentials" pane again from the menu on the left side of your screen

![plot](Images/16.png)

---
# Obtaining OAuth Credentials

- Select the application type "other" and enter a name for your set of credentials. Afterwards, click "create".

![plot](Images/17.png)

---
# OAuth Credentials Obtained

- You now have your first set of OAuth credentials for using the YouTube API

- Don't worry about closing the window, we can access it again anytime

![plot](Images/18.png)

---
# Testing Access

- You can safely try whether your *YouTube* API access works as intended by running the 
  following commands in `R`:

```{r eval = FALSE}
# installing the tuber package if not installed already
if("tuber" %in% installed.packages() != TRUE) {
  install.packages("tuber")
}

# loading tuber package
library(tuber)

# Your Credentials (NEVER SHARE THIS INFORMATION)
ID <- "ENTER-YOUR-APP-ID"
secret <- "ENTER-YOUR-APP-SECRET"

# authentication
yt_oauth(ID,secret)

# You will be asked in the R-console to
# save an access token: Select no
# You will be send to your browser to log in

```
---
# Login 

- Select the *Google* Account that you used to set up the credentials

![plot](Images/20.png)
---
# Granting Access to Your "Unsecure App" (1)

- As we did not verify our "App", *Google* labels it as "unsecure"
- Because we're the only ones using it, this shouldn't bother us. Click "Advanced" on the bottom left

![plot](Images/21.png)
---
# Granting Access to Your "Unsecure App" (2)

- Click "Go to [Name of your App] (unsafe)" on the bottom left of your screen

![plot](Images/22.png)

---
# Granting Access to Your "Unsecure App" (3)

- Click "Allow"

![plot](Images/23.png)

---
# Access "Unsecure App" (1)

- Click "Allow" again to confirm your choice

![plot](Images/24.png)
---
# Access "Unsecure App" (2)

- You should now see the message "Authentication complete. Please close this page and return to R"

![plot](Images/25.png)

---
# Test API call

- To easily check if everything worked, let's try to collect some simple data about a video.

```{r eval = FALSE}

# get statistics of https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HluANRwPyNo
get_stats(video_id="HluANRwPyNo")

```

---
# Output

- If everything worked correctly, your output structure should look something like this.
  The actual numbers will vary because they might change in the meantime.

```{r eval = FALSE}
$id
[1] "HluANRwPyNo"

$viewCount
[1] "10244939"

$likeCount
[1] "509791"

$dislikeCount
[1] "4799"

$favoriteCount
[1] "0"

$commentCount
[1] "20581"
```

# A Few Words of Advice on Handling Your *YouTube API Access*

- Have one account and project ready for the workshop for which you know that it works
- Do not use your API access too excessively before the workshop to avoid any risk of it being suspended
  
- Never share your OAuth login credentials! This can easily happen by accident when
  - saving code in a GitHub Repo
  - sending scripts to colleagues
  - troubleshooting someone elses code
  - for added security you can use the [`keyring` package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/keyring/keyring.pdf) (we'll say a bit more about this in the workshop)
