#### Extracting Subtitles ####
# Gets video info including the subtitles id
Caption_list1 <- list_caption_tracks(part = "snippet", video_id = "nI_OfkQOG6Q") # Video with 1 sub
Caption_list2 <- list_caption_tracks(part = "snippet", video_id = "C0AY3AN5kI4") # video with 1 automatically created sub
Caption_list3 <- list_caption_tracks(part = "snippet", video_id = "3TNkWTRNNYE") # video with 2 subs -> 400 error
Caption_list4 <- list_caption_tracks(part = "snippet", video_id = "j93NnRLyym0") # ASR exists, but not selectable
Caption_list5 <- list_caption_tracks(part = "snippet", video_id = "YgWgHRjv_Ps") # ARS exists, but no subs displayed
Caption_list6 <- list_caption_tracks(part = "snippet", video_id = "OuO135_5Rxk") # ARS exists, but no subs displayed

# Example with Video 3
# Extracts the id and converts it to string
ID_ASR <- toString(Caption_list3[1,"id"]) # automatically created subtitle
ID_DE <- toString(Caption_list3[2,"id"]) # German subtitle

# Retrieves the subtitles (format=raw)
Text_ASR <- rawToChar(get_captions(id = ID_ASR, format = "sbv")) # automatically created subtitle
Text_DE <- rawToChar(get_captions(id = ID_DE, format = "sbv")) # German subtitle (translated per default)
Text_GER <- rawToChar(get_captions(id = ID_DE, format = "sbv", lang = "de")) # German subtitle (in German)

# Known Issues
# 1. Videos can have more than one subtitle for the same language
# 2. If the video has disabled third party contributions for the subtitles, the query will result in a 403 error
#  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30653865/downloading-captions-always-returns-a-403

# Writes readable subtitles to file because subtools cannot read from variables

write(Text_DE, file = "Captions_DE.sbv", sep="\n")
write(Text_GER, file = "Captions_GER.sbv", sep="\n")

# Reads the subtitles file and converts it into a subtools object

Subs_DE <- read_subtitles("Captions_DE.sbv", format = "subviewer")

# How to do it easier with youtubecaption
# Put full URL into a variable
url <- "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TNkWTRNNYE"
# Get captions for that URL and put it into another variable
caption <- get_caption(url)
# You will receive an error message because the default is English captions "en", but this video has none
# Try German captions
caption <- get_caption(url, language = "de")
# Show that variable
caption
# You will see that this are the manual German captions. 
# There is no way to select the automatically created German captions because they are also labeled as "de".
# Save the caption as an Excel file and open it right away:
get_caption(url = url, savexl = TRUE, openxl = TRUE)
