In these exercises, we will be going through the dataset you preprocessed yesterday and perform three types of sentiment analysis:

1) Basic sentiment analysis of text
2) Slightly more elaborated sentiment analysis of text
3) Experimental sentiment analysis on emoji


```{block, box.title = "Exercise 1", box.body = list(fill = "white"), box.icon = "fa-star"}
Setup your `R` session and load your data (i.e., the parsed/processed comments) so that we can perform sentiment analysis. Assign the loaded data to a dataframe with the name `comments`.

```

```{block, opts.label = "clues"}
If your `R` version is < 4.0.0, you need to use the `options()` function to prevent `R` from interpreting your character variables as factor variables. If you are not sure how to use the `options()` function, you can always search it in *RStudio* help panel and have a look at all the different options . After setting the options, you should load your preprocessed dataset with `readRDS()`. Don't forget to also load the required packages `syuzhet` and `sentimentr`.

```

```{r, results = 'hide', solution = TRUE, warning=F,message=F}
# Preventing R from intepreting characters as factors
options(stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Loading packages
library(syuzhet)
library(sentimentr)

# Loading data
comments <- readRDS("../data/ParsedComments.rds")

```


```{block, box.title = "Exercise 2", box.body = list(fill = "white"), box.icon = "fa-star"}
Chose the appropriate column from your `comments` dataframe and run a basic sentiment analysis on it using the `syuzhet` package. Save the comment sentiments in a new variable called `BasicSentimentSyu` and check whether the column has any zero values. If there are zero values, why might this be the case?

```

```{block, opts.label = "clues"}
Hyperlinks and emojis might cause problems for the sentiment analysis (or any text mining methods, really). You can, e.g., check whether a variable contains a given value x using the following command `table(variable == x)` (with variable and x replaced by the appropriate variable name and value, of course).

```

```{r, solution = TRUE, warning=F,message=F}
# Creating new column with sentiment values
BasicSentimentSyu <- get_sentiment(comments$TextEmojiDeleted)

# Checking for zero values
table(BasicSentimentSyu == 0)

```

```{block, solution = TRUE}

Zero values are given to comments containing no words from the used dictionary or containing multiple words with sentiment scores that cancel each other out **exactly**.

```


```{block, box.title = "Exercise 3", box.body = list(fill = "white"), box.icon = "fa-star"}
Check the documentation of the `syuzhet` package and the `get_sentiment()` function to see which dictionaries are available. Create a correlation matrix for sentiment scores using the different methods (you can leave out Stanford). Which factors might lead to low correlations between the dictionaries? Which one is the best to use?
```

```{block, opts.label = "clues"}
You can find the documentation for the `get_sentiment()` function by searching for its name in the *RStudio* help panel or by running `?get_sentiment()` in your console. You can also search online for further information. A correlation matrix can be created with the `cor` function. As this function needs a dataframe as an input, you need to create one variable for each sentiment dictionary rating and combine it into a dataframe with `cbind.data.frame()` before passing it to `cor`.

```

```{block, solution = TRUE}

Which [dictionary](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.08319) is best always depends on your research question and what kind of data you want to use. In general, you should pick a dictionary that is as similar to your data as possible and is most sensitive to the kind of sentiment that you are interested in (dictionaries sometimes contain mainly positive or mainly negative entries).

```


```{r, solution = TRUE, warning=F,message=F}
# computing sentiment scores with different dictionaries
BasicSentimentSyu <- get_sentiment(comments$TextEmojiDeleted,method = "syuzhet")
BasicSentimentBing <- get_sentiment(comments$TextEmojiDeleted,method = "bing")
BasicSentimentAfinn <- get_sentiment(comments$TextEmojiDeleted,method = "afinn")
BasicSentimentNRC <- get_sentiment(comments$TextEmojiDeleted,method = "nrc")

# combining them into a dataframe
Sentiments <- cbind.data.frame(BasicSentimentSyu,
                               BasicSentimentBing,
                               BasicSentimentAfinn,
                               BasicSentimentNRC)
# setting colum names
colnames(Sentiments) <- c("Syuzhet",
                          "Bing",
                          "Afinn",
                          "NRC")

# correlation Matrix
cor(Sentiments)

```

```{block, box.title = "Exercise 4", box.body = list(fill = "white"), box.icon = "fa-star"}
Standardize the comment sentiments for the `syuzhet` method with respect to the total number of words in the respective comment. Call this new Variable `SentimentPerWord`.

```

```{block, opts.label = "clues"}
Computing the number of words requires multiple functions if you want to use base `R`. The `strplit()` command splits a character string into multiple strings on a specific indicator/separator, for example a space (" "). The `unlist()` command transfers a list of values into a regular vector. The `length()` function counts the number of elements in a vector and with the `sapply()` function you can apply a general function to each element of a vector. With these tools, you can compute the number of words per comment.

```

```{r, results = 'hide', solution = TRUE, warning=F, message=F}
# computing number of words
Words <- sapply(comments$TextEmojiDeleted,function(x){length(unlist(strsplit(x," ")))})

# computing average sentiment per word
SentimentPerWord <- BasicSentimentSyu/Words

```


```{block, box.title = "Exercise 5", box.body = list(fill = "white"), box.icon = "fa-star"}
Compute comment sentiments using the `sentimentr` package. Compare the average comment sentiment per word from the `sentimentr` package with the one we computed before. Which one do you think is more trustworthy and why?

```

```{block, opts.label = "clues"}
For a total sentiment score per comment, you first have to use the `get_sentences()` function and then use the `sentiment_by()` function on the sentences. To plot the two different scores against each other, you need to put them into the same dataframe with `cbind.data.frame()` first. You can then use the `ggplot2` package for plotting.

```

```{r, solution = TRUE, warning=F, message=F}
# computing sentiment scores
Sentences <- get_sentences(comments$TextEmojiDeleted)
SentDF <- sentiment_by(Sentences)

# show output
SentDF[1:3,c(2,3,4)]

# attaching ave_sentiment to comments dataframe
comments <- cbind.data.frame(comments,ave_sentiment = SentDF$ave_sentiment)

# plotting SentimentPerWord vs. SentimentR
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(comments, aes(x=ave_sentiment, y=SentimentPerWord)) + 
    geom_point(size =0.5) +
    ggtitle("Basic Sentiment Scores vs. `SentimentR`") +
    xlab("SentimentR Score") +
    ylab("Syuzhet Score") +
    geom_smooth(method=lm, se = TRUE)

```

```{block, solution = TRUE}
`SentimentR` is:
  - better at dealing with negations
  - better at detecting fixed expressions
  - better at detecting adverbs
  - better at detecting slang and abbreviations
```


```{block, box.title = "Exercise 6", box.body = list(fill = "white"), box.icon = "fa-star"}
Load the emoji dictionary from the `lexicon` package and assign it to a new object called `EmojiSentiments`. Change the formatting of the dictionary entries and/or the Emoji column so that they are in the same format and can be matched. You can use the name `EmojiToks` for an intermediary variable if you need to create one. Afterwards, transform the `EmojiSentiment` dataframe to a `quanteda` dictionary object with the `as.dictionary()` function. Finally, use the `tokens_lookup()` function to create a new variable for emoji sentiments called `EmojiToksSent`.
```

```{block, opts.label = "clues"}
To get an overview of all the available lexicons you can run `lexicon::available_data()`. The name of the emoji lexicon is "emojis_sentiment". Lexicons can be accessed with the command `lexicon::lexicon_name` usng the respective name of the lexicon you want to select. You can use the `paste0()` and `gsub()` functions to bring the formatting of the emoji column in line with the dictionary. Keep in mind that a valid dictionary needs appropriate column names, you can look this up in the help file for the `as.dictionary()` function.

```

```{r, solution = TRUE, warning=F, message=F}
# attaching packages
library(quanteda)
library(qdapRegex)

# emoji sentiments
EmojiSentiments <- lexicon::emojis_sentiment
EmojiSentiments[1:5,c(1,2,4)]

# changing formatting in dictionary
EmojiNames <- paste0("emoji_",gsub(" ","",EmojiSentiments$name))
EmojiSentiment <- cbind.data.frame(EmojiNames,
                                   EmojiSentiments$sentiment,
                                   EmojiSentiments$polarity)
# naming columns
names(EmojiSentiment) <- c("word","sentiment","valence")

# see results
EmojiSentiment[1:5,]

# tokenizing the emoji-only column in the formatted dataframe
EmojiToks <- tokens(tolower(as.character(unlist(comments$Emoji))))
EmojiToks[130:131]

# creating dictionary object
EmojiSentDict <- as.dictionary(EmojiSentiment[,1:2])

# replacing emojis with sentiment scores
EmojiToksSent <- tokens_lookup(x = EmojiToks,
                               dictionary = EmojiSentDict)
EmojiToksSent[130:131]

```


```{block, box.title = "Exercise 7", box.body = list(fill = "white"), box.icon = "fa-star"}
As a final exercise, plot the distribution of `EmojiToksSent` variable.

```

```{block, opts.label = "clues"}
You can use the simple `hist()` function to create a histogram. Keep in mind though that you need to transform the tokens object back into a regular numeric vector. You can do this with the `unlist()` and `as.numeric()` functions.

```

```{r, results = 'hide', solution = TRUE, warning=F, message=F}
hist(as.numeric(unlist(EmojiToksSent)),
     main = "Distribution of Emoji Sentiment",
     xlab = "Emoji Sentiment")

```
